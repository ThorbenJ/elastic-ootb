Helpers to try and get the bestElastic Stack Out-of-the-Box (OOTB) experience. 

## Getting Started

## Deployment

These scripts are for demonstration purposes only, they do not follow all production deployment
recommendations. Most notably they use the 'elastic' superuser and not a dedicated beats user.

## Contributing
